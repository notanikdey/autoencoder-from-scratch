The autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture designed to learn an efficient, compressed representation (encoding) of the input data in an unsupervised manner

It consists of two parts: 
* The encoder: maps the input to a lower-dimensional latent space (compressed representation)
* The decoder: reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation

The network is trained to minimize the difference between the original input and the reconstruction using the MSE loss function
